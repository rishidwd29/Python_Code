This is a tutorial project of the Django and this is the understanding and notes of that same thing

Manage.py:
Manage.py is the main file which will runs your server and in my understanding this is the file that defines host.
Url.py
Url.py is the file that stores your Urls or addresses that need to be stored . In other words it defines your structure of your web site 

let say your home page is 182.0.9.0 so your about page can be  182.0.9.0/about.

Views.py:
views is the file created by me and will be using it to display it thorough the url.py file as is will stores the address of that file.
